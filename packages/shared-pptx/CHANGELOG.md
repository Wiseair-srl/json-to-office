- 9bf85dd: feat(pptx): real validation for `pptx validate` — deep, path-aware checking of whole presentations

  `jto pptx validate` previously returned valid unconditionally: unknown component names, dead props (e.g. `fontColor` on `text`), and malformed trees all passed. shared-pptx now ships a unified validation facade (`validate` / `validateStrict`) mirroring shared-docx: a deep walk validates every component's props against its registry schema with precise JSON-pointer paths, enforces container narrowing (`pptx` → `slide` → content), rejects children on leaf components and unknown top-level fields, validates slide `placeholders` values, checks image source mutual exclusivity, and validates themes against `ThemeConfigSchema`. The CLI wires both `pptx` document and theme validation to it, and a missing/broken validation module now reports an error instead of silently passing the file.

- a332658: feat(docx,pptx): document-level default language with per-component overrides

  Documents and presentations can now declare a default proofing/spell-check language, with local overrides on the components where it makes sense.

  - **docx**: `props.language` (BCP-47, e.g. `"en-US"`) sets Word's document default via `docDefaults` (`w:docDefaults/w:rPrDefault/w:lang`). `paragraph` and `heading` gain a `language` override (emits a run-level `w:lang`) and a `noProof` toggle (emits `w:noProof`) to skip spell/grammar checking on code snippets, identifiers, etc. Runs without an override inherit the document default.
  - **docx `noProofWords`**: a "known words" allowlist on the document (`props.noProofWords`) — and per `paragraph`/`heading`, merged with the document list. Every whole-word, case-insensitive occurrence is split into its own `w:noProof` run so Word never flags it (brand names, technical terms), while the surrounding text stays spell-checked. A portable, document-embedded stand-in for a custom dictionary, since Word's real dictionaries can't be shipped inside a `.docx`. Applies across decorated text, hyperlinks and placeholders. (docx-only.)
  - **pptx**: `props.language` sets the default language for every text run (pptxgenjs `lang`), and `text` gains a `language` override. `noProof` is docx-only — PowerPoint's text runs don't expose a no-proof flag through pptxgenjs.

  Threaded through the shared schemas, the docx style/run pipeline (`createWordStyles`, `createText`, `createHeading`, the markdown/placeholder text-run builders) and the pptx slide context, so the language survives decorators, hyperlinks and placeholders.

### Minor Changes

- a079015: feat: forward `resources` from the highcharts component to the export server, and accept raw inline SVG markup as an image source (docx + pptx)

  **Highcharts `resources` (docx + pptx).** The `highcharts` component gains an optional `resources` prop (`{ css?, js?, files? }`) that is passed through verbatim to the Highcharts Export Server's `/export` payload. This unlocks the server's native `resources` contract — notably `@font-face` rules in `css` pointing at web-hosted `.woff2` files, so charts can render in custom fonts (e.g. Manrope, Carlito). Fully backward compatible: when `resources` is omitted the request body is byte-identical to before (no `resources` key sent). The object is forwarded as-is — no transform, re-serialize, or key stripping. In docx, `resources` is part of the component props, so it is already part of the render cache key — two charts differing only by `resources` are not deduped to the same image.

  **Inline SVG image source (docx + pptx).** The `image` component gains an `svg` prop alongside `path`/`base64`, so callers can drop raw `<svg>…</svg>` markup straight into the JSON instead of encoding it as a data URI or pointing at a file. Source precedence is `svg > base64 > path`; the markup is wrapped into an `image/svg+xml` data URI and flows through the existing pipeline. In docx it renders as a true vector (Word 2016+, with the usual PNG fallback) and honors width/height (intrinsic viewBox size when omitted), `%` widths, alignment, caption, floating, and table-cell placement; resolution is centralized in a shared `resolveImageSource()` helper used by every image render path (block, table cell, column layout), and document validation rejects an image that sets more than one of `path`/`base64`/`svg` with a path-aware error. In pptx the same `svg` source is embedded as a vector (PowerPoint 2016+, with pptxgenjs's PNG fallback) and participates in intrinsic-aspect auto-sizing (e.g. width-only → height derived from the viewBox) via the same precedence helper. Adds an `eldermoor-census` example custom component (docx) demonstrating how to expose structured data props and render them via the inline `svg` image source.

### Patch Changes

- 71faefc: fix(pptx): reject images that set more than one source (path/base64/svg)

  `path`, `base64`, and `svg` are mutually exclusive on the image component, but all three are optional fields on one object schema — so a multi-source payload passed the structural check and was silently resolved by runtime precedence. PPTX now collects these conflicts in an unconditional tree walk (`collectImageSourceConflicts`, mirroring core-docx) and fails generation with a `mutually_exclusive` error pointing at the offending component anywhere in the tree (slides, grids, containers, table cells). This brings pptx to full parity with docx, where the same conflict is already a hard error.

### Minor Changes

- de674e0: feat(schema): per-container narrowed children validation for DOCX and PPTX

  Each container component now declares its `allowedChildren`, and the schema
  generator builds per-container children unions instead of one flat recursive
  union. Monaco immediately flags invalid nesting (e.g. heading inside docx).

  Also skips auto-builds when JSON is syntactically invalid or has schema
  validation errors, preventing wasted server roundtrips during typing.
