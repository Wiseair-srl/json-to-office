# @json-to-office/jto-ops

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 5dc65ef: The `office-open` renderer is installed rather than advertised, and every surface
  that offers a renderer now says whether it can run.

  `@office-open/docx` and `@office-open/pptx` were optional peer dependencies, so on
  any install that did not opt in — `npx` above all, where there is no project to
  `pnpm add` into — the renderer was listed by `jto_info`, listed per component by
  `jto_discover`, validated against by `jto_validate`, and then failed every render.
  The `visual` component's `renderMode: "native"` went with it, since that mode is
  documented as requiring the backend. They are ordinary dependencies now: ESM-only,
  no native code, no install scripts, 7.4 MB.

  Availability is reported as well as fixed, because an `--omit=optional` install or
  a broken tree can still produce the same gap:

  - `RendererRegistry.statuses()` loads each registered renderer once, memoized, and
    reports `{ id, default, available, reason, installHint }`. Exposed as
    `docxRendererStatuses()` / `pptxRendererStatuses()` and as `rendererStatuses()`
    on the format adapters.
  - `jto_info` returns `formats[].renderers[]` beside the existing `rendererIds`,
    and warns with the install line for any renderer that cannot load.
  - `jto_discover` marks each renderer profile `available`.
  - `jto_validate` warns when the profile a document will actually build with has no
    backend, instead of returning a clean result that the next call contradicts.

  Two error-reporting fixes alongside it:

  - `jto_preview` classified a missing backend as a generic build failure and
    suggested "a build failure is a defect in the JSON, not in the renderer" —
    sending the caller to validate a document that was never at fault. It now
    returns `E_DEPENDENCY_MISSING`, as `jto_generate` already did, and skips the
    validation pass that only added noise.
  - An internal failure no longer puts `error.stack` — absolute filesystem paths and
    module layout — into the tool result, where it reached whatever transcript the
    client keeps. Set `JTO_MCP_DEBUG_STACKS=1` to restore it.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ad35065: Extract the host operations layer into `@json-to-office/jto-ops`: format adapters, the LibreOffice pptx rasterizer and the platform font stagers now live in a package with no terminal dependencies, so hosts without a UI can use them without pulling in ink, react, commander or chalk. `@json-to-office/jto-cli` re-exports every moved symbol at the same name, so its API is unchanged.
