## 0.5.3

### Patch Changes

- a89a7cc: feat: use Monaco built-in JSON schema validation for theme editor

  Replace custom `validateThemeJson` marker-setting with Monaco's native `onValidate`, add ValidationPanel/StatusBar UI, and tighten theme schemas with `additionalProperties: false`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- de674e0: feat(schema): per-container narrowed children validation for DOCX and PPTX

  Each container component now declares its `allowedChildren`, and the schema
  generator builds per-container children unions instead of one flat recursive
  union. Monaco immediately flags invalid nesting (e.g. heading inside docx).

  Also skips auto-builds when JSON is syntactically invalid or has schema
  validation errors, preventing wasted server roundtrips during typing.
