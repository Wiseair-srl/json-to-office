- 2dff712: fix(docx): validate component props in every nested container and in header/footer regions

  The CLI/library document validator (`validate.jsonDocument` / `validate.document`) only re-validated the root's direct children and one level of `section` children. Component props nested inside `text-box`/`columns` children (any depth) and inside section `header`/`footer` regions — which the section schema types loosely as an array of `Type.Any()` (or the `'linkToPrevious'` literal) — were never deep-checked. As a result a document could pass `jto docx validate` (even `--strict`) while still violating the schema (e.g. `boldColor` placed inside `font`, `font.size` above the 72 pt cap, a scalar `characterSpacing`), whereas the in-editor (Monaco) validator — which runs the generated JSON Schema over the whole tree — flagged all of them.

  The deep validator now walks the entire component tree: every container's shared `children` field to any depth, the `header`/`footer` paragraph regions under `props`, and the component content nested inside `table` cells and column headers. A non-array `children` on any nested container (`section`/`columns`/`text-box`) is now reported at its own path too — previously only a `section`'s was, so a deeper malformed subtree could slip through as valid. `header`/`footer` entries are also checked for component structure (not just props), matching the editor's whole-tree schema, which resolves those regions to the component union even though the static section schema types them as `Type.Any()`. No schema or rule changed — only validation coverage.

  This closes the table-cell gap as well: the static cell-content schema types cell `props` as `additionalProperties: true`, so a capped prop deep in a `table` cell (e.g. `font.size` over the cap) used to pass the CLI while the editor's recursive schema rejected it; the walk now re-validates each cell/header content component against its real schema, to any nesting depth (e.g. a table inside a table cell). `list` props (including item formatting) were already covered by the list's own props schema. The CLI and the playground now report the same errors at the same paths.

- a332658: feat(docx,pptx): document-level default language with per-component overrides

  Documents and presentations can now declare a default proofing/spell-check language, with local overrides on the components where it makes sense.

  - **docx**: `props.language` (BCP-47, e.g. `"en-US"`) sets Word's document default via `docDefaults` (`w:docDefaults/w:rPrDefault/w:lang`). `paragraph` and `heading` gain a `language` override (emits a run-level `w:lang`) and a `noProof` toggle (emits `w:noProof`) to skip spell/grammar checking on code snippets, identifiers, etc. Runs without an override inherit the document default.
  - **docx `noProofWords`**: a "known words" allowlist on the document (`props.noProofWords`) — and per `paragraph`/`heading`, merged with the document list. Every whole-word, case-insensitive occurrence is split into its own `w:noProof` run so Word never flags it (brand names, technical terms), while the surrounding text stays spell-checked. A portable, document-embedded stand-in for a custom dictionary, since Word's real dictionaries can't be shipped inside a `.docx`. Applies across decorated text, hyperlinks and placeholders. (docx-only.)
  - **pptx**: `props.language` sets the default language for every text run (pptxgenjs `lang`), and `text` gains a `language` override. `noProof` is docx-only — PowerPoint's text runs don't expose a no-proof flag through pptxgenjs.

  Threaded through the shared schemas, the docx style/run pipeline (`createWordStyles`, `createText`, `createHeading`, the markdown/placeholder text-run builders) and the pptx slide context, so the language survives decorators, hyperlinks and placeholders.

- a079015: feat: forward `resources` from the highcharts component to the export server, and accept raw inline SVG markup as an image source (docx + pptx)

  **Highcharts `resources` (docx + pptx).** The `highcharts` component gains an optional `resources` prop (`{ css?, js?, files? }`) that is passed through verbatim to the Highcharts Export Server's `/export` payload. This unlocks the server's native `resources` contract — notably `@font-face` rules in `css` pointing at web-hosted `.woff2` files, so charts can render in custom fonts (e.g. Manrope, Carlito). Fully backward compatible: when `resources` is omitted the request body is byte-identical to before (no `resources` key sent). The object is forwarded as-is — no transform, re-serialize, or key stripping. In docx, `resources` is part of the component props, so it is already part of the render cache key — two charts differing only by `resources` are not deduped to the same image.

  **Inline SVG image source (docx + pptx).** The `image` component gains an `svg` prop alongside `path`/`base64`, so callers can drop raw `<svg>…</svg>` markup straight into the JSON instead of encoding it as a data URI or pointing at a file. Source precedence is `svg > base64 > path`; the markup is wrapped into an `image/svg+xml` data URI and flows through the existing pipeline. In docx it renders as a true vector (Word 2016+, with the usual PNG fallback) and honors width/height (intrinsic viewBox size when omitted), `%` widths, alignment, caption, floating, and table-cell placement; resolution is centralized in a shared `resolveImageSource()` helper used by every image render path (block, table cell, column layout), and document validation rejects an image that sets more than one of `path`/`base64`/`svg` with a path-aware error. In pptx the same `svg` source is embedded as a vector (PowerPoint 2016+, with pptxgenjs's PNG fallback) and participates in intrinsic-aspect auto-sizing (e.g. width-only → height derived from the viewBox) via the same precedence helper. Adds an `eldermoor-census` example custom component (docx) demonstrating how to expose structured data props and render them via the inline `svg` image source.

- 542f8ad: fix(docx): surface invalid props on generation instead of silently dropping them

  Closes a correctness gap where the object/buffer generation path accepted malformed input and emitted a silently-wrong document. A typo'd prop such as `lineSpacing: { name: 'single' }` (should be `{ type: 'single' }`) used to be quietly discarded, shipping a document with the property missing. Generation now validates by default — the same check the playground already performs — and reports the error instead of producing corrupt output.

  - **Validation on generation (default on).** `generateDocumentFromJson` / `generateBufferFromJson` validate both string and object input and throw `JsonValidationError` on invalid documents. The plugin generator (`createDocumentGenerator().generate/generateBuffer/generateFile`) validates plugin-aware (standard + registered custom components) and throws `ComponentValidationError`. Need the old pass-through behavior? Set `validation: { enabled: false }`.
  - **Clearer messages for typo'd keys.** Component prop objects reject unknown properties, so a misspelled key surfaces as `Unexpected property "<key>"` rather than being ignored. Highcharts `options` stays an open passthrough.
  - **`allowUnknownFields` opt-out.** `validation: { allowUnknownFields: true }` strips unknown properties instead of rejecting them — a one-line migration aid for documents carrying stray keys. Required and typed fields are still enforced.
  - **Plugin validation fixes.** The plugin generator previously computed validation and discarded the result (so it never reported anything), and `generator.validate()` always returned `{ valid: true }`. Both now work, and registered custom components are no longer mistakenly rejected.

  The playground JSON Schema and the runtime validator both derive from the same TypeBox definitions, so they stay in sync. If a document relied on invalid props being silently dropped, pass `validation: { allowUnknownFields: true }` (strip unknown keys) or `validation: { enabled: false }` (skip validation) to keep the prior behavior.

- 95cc7c4: feat(docx): `visual` component — embed pptx-rendered graphics as PNGs

  Author a free-canvas graphic as a single pptx slide directly inside a
  `.docx.json` document; it is rasterized to a PNG at build time and embedded as
  an image. Unlocks absolute positioning, overlapping shapes and layered art
  (infographics, diagrams, hero compositions) that the docx flow layout cannot
  express — while the visual stays plain, diffable, deterministic JSON.

  Mirrors the `highcharts` pattern: the component offloads rendering to an
  injected service (`services.pptx`) and desugars to a plain `image`. The
  published engine packages stay pure JS — no binary dependency.

  - New `visual` standard component (`canvas` + pptx `elements`, plus
    image-style placement props: `width`, `alignment`, `caption`, `spacing`,
    `floating`). Allowed inside `section` and `columns`.
  - First-class validation: `elements` are validated against the real PPTX
    slide-content union (`PptxSlideContentSchema`, new in
    `@json-to-office/shared-pptx`) — same authoring fidelity as a standalone
    `.pptx.json`, with full Monaco autocomplete. Hoisted into a single
    `PptxSlideContent` JSON-Schema definition (no per-use inlining).
  - New `services.pptx` config (`PptxServiceConfig`): inject an in-process
    `render` callback or an HTTP `serverUrl`; per-component `dpi`/`serverUrl`
    overrides.
  - `createLibreOfficePptxRasterizer()` (from `@json-to-office/jto-cli`):
    pptx → (LibreOffice) PDF → (poppler `pdftoppm`) PNG, with a content-addressed
    on-disk cache. Wired into the `jto` CLI/server docx path automatically; point
    at a remote rasterizer with `JTO_PPTX_RASTERIZER_URL`.
  - `flattenVisuals(doc, { rasterize, dpi })` (re-exported from
    `@json-to-office/json-to-docx`): desugar every `visual` → `image{base64}`
    ahead of time, producing a portable document that builds with no service
    configured.
  - `POST /api/pptx/rasterize` on the `jto` server: `{ presentation, dpi }` →
    `{ base64DataUri, width, height }`, the HTTP backend for `services.pptx.serverUrl`.
  - `jto-render-server` — a standalone combined server (`packages/jto/dist/render-server.js`)
    that serves `POST /rasterize` and reverse-proxies everything else to a
    co-located Highcharts Export Server, so one Render instance backs both
    `services.highcharts` and `services.pptx`. Deployed via the renamed
    `services/jto-render-server` image (Chromium + LibreOffice + poppler).
  - Example: `examples/visual-infographic.docx.json`.

  Robustness:

  - Visuals render and flatten in every position — section/column children,
    section headers/footers, and table cells/headers — not just top-level
    children. `flattenVisuals` rasterizes with bounded concurrency and skips
    disabled visuals.
  - DPI policy is centralized (`DEFAULT/MIN/MAX_VISUAL_DPI`, range 36–600) and
    enforced everywhere; the public `/rasterize` shares one validated handler
    (body-size limit, rate limit, dpi clamp) with the in-app route.
  - The combined server's `/health` reflects the highcharts upstream's readiness;
    proxy and rasterize fetches have timeouts; the entrypoint supervises (restarts)
    highcharts. The rasterizer cache writes atomically and validates PNGs (no
    truncated/0×0 images), and binary resolution is memoized.

- 938bdda: fix(validate): recognize `docx` (and any registered root) in deep validator

  The CLI `validate` command emitted false-negatives — `root: Invalid component
configuration for 'docx'` plus `/name: Unknown component "docx"` — on documents
  that `generate` accepts cleanly. The deep validator's component-schema lookup
  was hardcoded with a stale `report` entry and no `docx` entry, so the root
  `name: "docx"` was reported as unknown.

  The lookup table now comes from `STANDARD_COMPONENTS_REGISTRY` (the single
  source of truth), and the comprehensive validator strips TypeBox's generic
  discriminated-union catch-all so it never appears alongside the precise,
  path-aware diagnostics the deep validator already produces.

  Also skips auto-builds when JSON is syntactically invalid or has schema
  validation errors, preventing wasted server roundtrips during typing.
