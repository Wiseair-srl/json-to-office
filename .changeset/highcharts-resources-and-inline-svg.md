feat: forward `resources` from the highcharts component to the export server, and accept raw inline SVG markup as an image source (docx + pptx)

**Highcharts `resources` (docx + pptx).** The `highcharts` component gains an optional `resources` prop (`{ css?, js?, files? }`) that is passed through verbatim to the Highcharts Export Server's `/export` payload. This unlocks the server's native `resources` contract — notably `@font-face` rules in `css` pointing at web-hosted `.woff2` files, so charts can render in custom fonts (e.g. Manrope, Carlito). Fully backward compatible: when `resources` is omitted the request body is byte-identical to before (no `resources` key sent). The object is forwarded as-is — no transform, re-serialize, or key stripping. In docx, `resources` is part of the component props, so it is already part of the render cache key — two charts differing only by `resources` are not deduped to the same image.

**Inline SVG image source (docx + pptx).** The `image` component gains an `svg` prop alongside `path`/`base64`, so callers can drop raw `<svg>…</svg>` markup straight into the JSON instead of encoding it as a data URI or pointing at a file. Source precedence is `svg > base64 > path`; the markup is wrapped into an `image/svg+xml` data URI and flows through the existing pipeline. In docx it renders as a true vector (Word 2016+, with the usual PNG fallback) and honors width/height (intrinsic viewBox size when omitted), `%` widths, alignment, caption, floating, and table-cell placement; resolution is centralized in a shared `resolveImageSource()` helper used by every image render path (block, table cell, column layout), and document validation rejects an image that sets more than one of `path`/`base64`/`svg` with a path-aware error. In pptx the same `svg` source is embedded as a vector (PowerPoint 2016+, with pptxgenjs's PNG fallback) and participates in intrinsic-aspect auto-sizing (e.g. width-only → height derived from the viewBox) via the same precedence helper. Adds an `eldermoor-census` example custom component (docx) demonstrating how to expose structured data props and render them via the inline `svg` image source.
