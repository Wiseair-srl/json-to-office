feat(core-docx): per-call `preserveCustomComponents` option on `generate` / `generateBuffer` / `generateFile`. Listed component names are kept verbatim (un-expanded) in a new `preservedDefinition` field on the result; `standardDefinition` and the rendered DOCX are unchanged. `generateFile` also writes a JSON sidecar (default `<out>-preserved.json`, override via `preservedOutputPath`). Unknown names throw `UnknownPreservedComponentError` (exported from `@json-to-office/shared` and `@json-to-office/core-docx`).
