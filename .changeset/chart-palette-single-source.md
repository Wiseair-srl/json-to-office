feat(themes): one chart palette vocabulary for DOCX and PPTX

The default chart palette was declared twice with two different token lists: PPTX resolved `primary, secondary, accent, accent4, accent5, accent6`, while the DOCX `highcharts` component resolved only `primary, secondary, accent` — and the DOCX theme schema had no way to spell the other three, so a document could not reach them even deliberately.

- `DEFAULT_CHART_THEME_COLORS` moves to `@json-to-office/shared` and is exported from its root. `@json-to-office/core-pptx`'s `utils/color` re-exports it, so every PPTX call site keeps importing colours from the module it already used.
- The DOCX `ThemeConfigSchema` gains optional `accent4`, `accent5`, and `accent6`, named to match the PPTX theme. The schema is strictly more permissive: a theme JSON carrying those keys used to be rejected at load and is now accepted, and every theme that validated before still validates.
- The DOCX `highcharts` component resolves all six tokens, in the same order PPTX does. A theme that fills every slot with a hex value now produces the same palette in a document and in a deck, letter case included.
- **Both** chart palettes resolve each token through the theme's own recursive name resolution instead of prefixing a `#` to the raw value. `"accent4": "primary"` used to post the literal string `"#primary"` to the export server and now posts the colour `primary` holds; a value that resolves to nothing (a typo'd token name, or a reference cycle) is skipped instead of being handed to the renderer verbatim. A token whose value is literal hex — every bundled theme and the overwhelming majority of custom ones — produces a byte-identical payload, original letter case included.

  On the PPTX side this was the same defect with a worse symptom: `"accent4": "primary"` reached pptxgenjs as the literal token name, which it answered by painting the series **black** and logging to the console while the generation `warnings` array stayed empty and the exit code stayed 0. Both the native `chart` and the `highcharts` paths were affected. A PPTX theme colour that is defined but resolves to nothing now raises an `UNKNOWN_COLOR` warning and falls back to `primary` instead of being passed through unvalidated — and because that lives in `resolveColor`, it applies to **every** PPTX colour prop (text, shape, table, image, template), not only charts. Callers counting warnings on a broken theme will see one more; nothing changes for a theme whose colours are all literal hex, which is every bundled PPTX theme.

  Note the asymmetry in what the two schemas will even accept: a DOCX theme colour may be `#RRGGBB` or another colour's name, while a PPTX theme colour must be strict hex, so a PPTX reference chain only arrives through a theme the schema never validates — a `customThemes` object, a `--theme-path` file (parsed as plain JSON), or an inline `props.theme` in a run that never calls the validator. Those are exactly the paths where the black series showed up.

  When _no_ token resolves — a hand-written theme whose colours are all CSS names, say — the native `chart` now leaves `chartColors` unset instead of passing an empty array. pptxgenjs indexes `chartColors[i % 0]`, gets `undefined`, and paints every series black without warning; omitting the option hands it its own default palette. The `highcharts` paths already guarded this.

  One deliberate divergence: a reference cycle is "unresolvable" on the PPTX side (dropped from the implicit palette, `UNKNOWN_COLOR` when named explicitly), because `chainToHex` carries a `seen` guard. DOCX's `resolveColor` has no cycle guard; the chart palette catches the resulting stack overflow and drops the slot, but naming a cycled token from an ordinary colour prop still blows the stack.

**Charts recolour only where a theme actually defines the new tokens.** The five bundled DOCX themes define none, so their charts keep the three-colour palette they had. A theme handed to the library as an object — through `customThemes`, or the `theme` option on `createDocumentGenerator` — that already carried `accent4`–`accent6` bypassed schema validation and was silently ignored by DOCX charts; those charts now pick the extra colours up. Explicit `options.colors` still wins everywhere.

**Both formats now treat a slot the theme leaves unset the same way: they skip it.** The implicit palette is only as long as the theme has tokens defined, no warning is emitted, and the chart library reuses the shorter list. Skipping compacts rather than leaving a gap — a theme with `accent5` but no `accent4` yields `[primary, secondary, accent, accent5]`, so `accent5` paints the fourth series. An explicit palette is unaffected: a `highcharts` `options.colors` is still forwarded untouched in both formats, and a PPTX `chartColors` entry naming an unset token still resolves to `primary` with a `THEME_COLOR_FALLBACK` warning, because naming a token you never defined is an authoring error rather than a partially filled theme.

That unification is the PPTX-side behaviour change: a PPTX theme leaving `accent4`–`accent6` unset used to get a six-entry palette with `primary` repeated in slots 4–6, plus three `THEME_COLOR_FALLBACK` warnings per chart. It now gets a shorter palette and no warnings, so series 4+ cycle the theme's colours instead of all painting `primary`. All three bundled PPTX themes fill every slot, so decks on a bundled theme are unchanged; custom PPTX themes with holes will see charts recolour and pipeline warning counts drop. DOCX already skipped and is unchanged in this respect.

`resolveColor`, `isValidColorName` and `getAvailableColorNames` in core-docx also stopped keying off `in`: an optional colour slot that is present but `undefined` counts as unset everywhere. `resolveColor` raises the same strict `Invalid color value` error as for an absent slot rather than a `TypeError`, `isValidColorName` returns `false` for that slot, and `getAvailableColorNames` omits it.
